Subject: Thunderbird Community Metrics $date2 ($date1): Bugzilla, Phabricator, Crash Stats and Code Coverage

Hello Thunderbird Community,

Welcome to the Thunderbird Community Metrics, which are designed to complement Magnus‚Äôs existing ‚ÄúThunderbird Metrics‚Äù e-mail, while providing data from additional sources. There are a total of six e-mails, covering 13 sources:

1. Bugzilla/BMO, Phabricator, Crash Stats and Thunderbird Code Coverage
2. GitHub
3. Thunderbird Stats and Mozilla Connect
4. Thunderbird Add-ons/ATN
5. Support (Mozilla Support/SUMO, Mozilla Discourse and Topicbox)
6. Localization (Pontoon and Weblate)

This is e-mail 1 of 6 of the Thunderbird Community Metrics. It includes inline graphs, so viewing the HTML version is recommended. Tables are included as a fallback and hidden by default when viewing the HTML version. Note that the SVG graphs may not display correctly in other e-mail clients (e.g. Gmail, Topicbox website). PNG versions of the graphs are also attached, as well as the raw CSV data.
